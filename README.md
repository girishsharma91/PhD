# PhD
contains my PhD codes

Programming done during PhD:
List of codes:
1. Method of moments 3D printer model (4 differential equations)
2. Monodisperse model Charging + Coagulation (2*(2*n+1) + 2) differential eqautions
3. Method of moments Charging + coagulation (3*(2*n+1) + 2) differential equations
   > n=0: only neutral particles
   > n=1: neutral particles + +1/-1 charged particles
   > n=2: neutral particles + +1/+2/-1/-2 charged particles
4. General dynamic Equation: Different codes to solve it (ADM-AAQRL)
5. Molecular Dynamics Simulations
6. DMA COMSOL
