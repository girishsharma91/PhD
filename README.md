# PhD
contains my PhD codes

Programming done during PhD:
List of codes:

1. General dynamic Equation: Different models to solve it (ADM-AAQRL): https://github.com/AAQRL/aerosol_dynamic_models/tree/master/AAQRL-ADM
2. Monodisperse model Charging + Coagulation (2*(2*n+1) + 2) differential eqautions
3. Method of moments Charging + coagulation (3*(2*n+1) + 2) differential equations
   > n=0: only neutral particles;
   > n=1: neutral particles + +1/-1 charged particles;
   > n=2: neutral particles + +1/+2/-1/-2 charged particles;
4. Molecular Dynamics Simulations
